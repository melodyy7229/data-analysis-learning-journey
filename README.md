# Data Analysis Learning Journey
This repository documents my 12-week journey learning data analysis and AI.

## Week 1 - Programming Foundations for Data Analysis
- `Week1_Day4_Python_Basics.ipynb`: Python review covering variables, data types, and if/else logic.
- `Week1_Day5_Control_Flow.ipynb`: Python review covering if/else logic, for, and while.

## Week 2 - Data Foundations & Cleaning
- `Week2_Day1_Pandas_Intro.ipynb`:  Completed the first two core modules— “Creating, Reading and Writing” and “Indexing, Selecting & Assigning”—in the Pandas course on Kaggle Learn. Practiced coding Jupyter Notebook to reinforce data structures and selection techniques.
- `Week2_Day2_Dictionary_Basics.ipynb`: Learned how to use Python dictionaries to store data using key-value pairs, and practiced basic operations like adding, updating, and looping through dictionary items.
- `Week2_Day3_Pandas_Basics.ipynb`: Found a simple CSV dataset. Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv() in Jupyter Notebook. Performed initial data exploration with .head(), .info(), and .describe(). Practiced selecting single and multiple columns, and filtering rows based on conditions to better understand basic data manipulation techniques.
- `Week2_Day4_Netflix_Cleaning.ipynb`: Downloaded the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset from Kaggle and loaded the netflix_titles.csv file into a new Jupyter Notebook. Performed basic data cleaning: checked for missing values, handled them preliminarily, and reviewed data types.
